# Tetris-Clone

A Tetris clone created in c# by Muntaqim Rahman and Carson Hall. 
It does follow all official Tetris guidelines with the exception of the level up system. The number of lines required to level up increases over time, thus allowing a longer game.

All code is also copied into an extra "code folder" at the root directory. It includes all classes, subclasses, and form code.

Special moves like T-spins and wall kicks are included.

Controls follow standard Keyboard Tetris:

Left/Right Arrow Keys to move Left/Right
Up - Rotates Clockwise
Z - Rotates Counterclockwise

Hold Down - Accelerates Drop for Soft Drop
Space - Hard Drop

C - Holds Item
