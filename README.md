# Tetris-Clone

A Tetris clone created in c# by Muntaqim Rahman and Carson Hall. 
It does follow all official Tetris guidelines with the exception of the level up system. The number of lines required to level up increases over time, thus allowing a longer game. The executable can be found in: Tetris-Game/Tetris-Game/obj/Debug/Tetris-Game.exe

The game manual outlines all rules and controls for the game.

The file path for the executable can be found in : Tetris-Game/Tetris-Game/bin/Release/app.publish/Tetris-Game.exe
